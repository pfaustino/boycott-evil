High‑leverage structured datasets
These are the most directly usable as data (not just articles):

TechForPalestine datasets (GitHub) – Already in YAML → CSV/JSON for:

Consumer goods brands to boycott and suggested alternatives.
​

Tech/SaaS companies to boycott, with categories and notes.

Great seed for non-food (apps, cloud, devices, etc.).

Logical Harmony “Brands to Avoid” – Large A–Z list of cosmetics, personal care, household brands that are not cruelty-free.
​
You’d need to scrape/clean this into { brand, parent_company, reason: "animal testing / unknown" }.

UN / NGO settlement-related business lists – Companies tied to occupied-territory settlements; often names + sectors, good for banks, construction, tourism, tech.

More institutional/finance than consumer, but you can still flag them.

Curated boycott lists to mine
These are more “content” sites you turn into structured data yourself:

Ethical Consumer “Boycotts List” – Central hub of ongoing boycotts: banks, supermarkets, fashion, telecoms, fossil fuel companies, etc.
​
For each campaign, extract company names, sector, and why.

USCPR / BDS 2025 Boycott List – Priority brands and corporations tied to Palestine-related campaigns (Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, etc.).
​
Good overlap with mainstream non-food brands.

Cruelty-free / animal-rights lists – e.g., PETA resources or Logical Harmony “brands to avoid” for animal testing.
​
Adds cosmetics, home cleaning, personal care.

Fast fashion & greenwashing lists – Many sites list brands to avoid (Shein, H&M, Boohoo, etc.) with reasons (labor, environment, greenwashing).

Use these to tag fashion/clothing companies.
